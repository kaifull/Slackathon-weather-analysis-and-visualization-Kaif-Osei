# Weather analysis and visualization
Ever wondered how the news channel predicts weather condition accurately? It’s because they leverage data science which is always working in the background in the process of weather prediction. For all individual and organization, it is extremely useful to know accurate weather condition. This helps business work with more accuracy and without any disruptions. In this challenge analyze and interpret various weather patterns, create weather forecasts, and develop visualization to showcase the result effectively.
# What is the problem?
Weather forecasting is a vital application in meteorology and has been one of the most scientifically and technologically challenging problem around the world like for example in farming aviation, marine, fire and transportation and so on. Aviation forecast in order to look surface observation during heavy wind blowing, creating problem during takeoff and landing. Every member of population use weather data on regular intervals, thinking of how weather can affect your travel activity and business decision for the list of users become longer.
# How can technology help us.
By keeping in mind above mentioned problem the word “Data science” came into picture and how the data science with combination of AI and ML really to get of this kind of issue.
Real time weather monitoring 
Provide Long-Term Weather Forecast (temperature and rainfall).
Solve real time problem all around the world just happening because of climate change
